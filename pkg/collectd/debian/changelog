  Import package splitting from Seb Harl's Debian packaging repository for
  collectd at http://git.tokkee.org/pkg-collectd.git, thus splitting the package
  into the collectd, collectd-core, collectd-utils, libcollectdclient1, and
  libcollectdclient-dev packages, facilitating straightforward upgrades from the
  Debian/Ubuntu packages.

collectd (5.3.0-ppa4) precise; urgency=low

  Ensure that plugin dependencies are not all automatically installed. Now,
  instead of pulling in all plugin dependencies transitively, they are listed in
  the "Suggests:" field of the debian package. If you need support for a
  particular plugin, you will need to ensure that the appropriate libraries have
  been installed.
