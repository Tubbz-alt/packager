rbenv (0.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The rbenv-alternatives plugin in this release changes the interaction
  with Rubygems: when you use the pseudo interpreters provided by `rbenv
  alternatives`, the main gems directory will be
  ~/.rbenv/versions/$version/gems instead of the system gems dir.

  - This means that `gem install` will install to this new dir, and the
    installed gems will be available for you to `require` them (of
    course, on Ruby 1.8 we have to require rubygems first).
  - Programs from gems are available through the standard rbenv
    mechanism, so they are only available if you are using the same
    rbenv version you used to install them.
  - You don't need to use sudo to install gems.
  - If you do use sudo, the gems will be installed to the system gems
    directory.
